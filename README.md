# Quick and dirty Python test
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SongGithub/unicorn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SongGithub/unicorn)
 - download the `solution.py` and `test.py` files
 - implement the 4 functions in the `solution.py` file
 - all the tests should pass when you execute the `test.py`
 - using third party libraries is discouraged (you might want `certifi`)

Solutions should use Python 3. Please include a `requirements.txt` file if your solution requires third party libraries.
